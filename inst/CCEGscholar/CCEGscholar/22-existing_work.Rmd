Make a list of tutorials, research projects etc. 

Things/people to reference:

Laurel Brake, Jim Mussell, other HMD advisory board people, Joad Raymond (don't forget about News networks)

Bob Nicholson, Melodee Beals, Ryan Cordell

Bloggers like Bruno Rodrigues

The BL Labs stuff on github

Other code repositories would be good.
